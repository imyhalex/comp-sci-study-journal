Not exactly — the excerpt you shared covers **application layer design in general**, and *microservices* are just one part of that discussion. Let’s break it down:

### What it’s saying

1. **Application Layer vs Web Layer**

   * The *web layer* handles HTTP requests/responses (e.g., Nginx, load balancer, API gateway).
   * The *application layer (platform layer)* runs your business logic (e.g., API servers, workers, background jobs).
   * Separating them means you can scale independently (add more app servers without touching web servers).

2. **Workers and Asynchronism**

   * Application layer isn’t just synchronous APIs — it can also have background workers for tasks like sending emails, processing images, etc.

3. **Microservices (one possible design)**

   * Instead of one big monolithic application layer, you can split it into **independently deployable services** (user, feed, search, upload, etc.).
   * These communicate over lightweight APIs (usually HTTP or gRPC).

4. **Service Discovery**

   * Once you have many services, you need a way for them to find each other dynamically. That’s where tools like **Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper** come in.

5. **Disadvantages**

   * Moving from monolith → microservices introduces complexity in deployments, operations, monitoring, and team processes.

### So to answer you directly

* The **whole section is about the application layer**.
* Within that, **microservices are introduced as one architectural approach** to designing the application layer (but not the only one).
* You could still have a **monolithic application layer** (all logic in one deployable unit) or a **microservices-based application layer** (many small services).

In short:

* **Application layer = general concept** (business logic layer).
* **Microservices = one way to implement the application layer**.
