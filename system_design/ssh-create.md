Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s a **step-by-step, clean, and complete guide** to creating an SSH key and setting it up for GitHub access using a custom alias (e.g., `github.com-github`) in your WSL/Ubuntu system.

## âœ… Step-by-Step: Create & Configure SSH Key for GitHub in WSL

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Open Terminal in WSL (Ubuntu)**

Use your WSL terminal to run the following commands.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Generate a New SSH Key**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ys4689@nyu.edu" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

* `-t ed25519`: Use modern, secure key type
* `-C "ys4689@nyu.edu"`: Comment helps identify your key (email)
* `-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`: Saves the key as this filename

ðŸ”¸ When prompted:

* Press **Enter** to skip passphrase (or set one for added security)
* The key pair is saved to:

  * Private key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`
  * Public key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub`

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Start the SSH Agent and Add the Key**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

This loads your private key into memory so it can be used for authentication.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Add the SSH Key to GitHub**

1. Show your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub
   ```

   Copy the entire output (starts with `ssh-ed25519`).

2. Go to: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

3. Click **"New SSH key"**:

   * **Title**: `WSL GitHub Key` or similar
   * **Key**: Paste what you copied
   * Click **Add SSH Key**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Configure SSH to Use This Key for GitHub**

Edit (or create) your SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following:

```ssh
# GitHub personal account
Host github.com-github
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

ðŸ“Œ This tells SSH to use your custom key **only when connecting to `github.com-github`**.

Save and exit: `Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Test the SSH Connection**

Now test that GitHub accepts your SSH key:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful, youâ€™ll see:

```
Hi ys4689! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. Clone or Configure Git Repo Using Custom Host**

When cloning:

```bash
git clone git@github.com-github:your-username/your-repo.git
```

Or to change an existing remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-github:your-username/your-repo.git
```

## ðŸ§  Quick Recap

| Step | Action                                                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github` |
| 2    | `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`                             |
| 3    | Add key to GitHub                                              |
| 4    | Edit `~/.ssh/config`                                           |
| 5    | `ssh -T git@github.com-github` to test                         |
| 6    | Use `git@github.com-github:...` when cloning                   |

Let me know if you want a version of this for **GitLab** or need help managing multiple identities.


You're seeing repeated attempts from **VS Code Remote - SSH extension**, which is trying to interpret a Git SSH URL (`git@gitlab.com:...`) as a **remote development host** â€” that's not what you want when you're cloning a repo.

---

## ðŸ›‘ What's Happening

VS Code is **misinterpreting** your Git SSH URL as a **Remote SSH Host**. It tries to open a dev container or SSH session, but it fails, then retries over and over.

---

## âœ… How to Stop It

### Option 1: **Close Remote Window in VS Code**

If you see `ðŸ”Œ SSH: git@gitlab.com` in the bottom-left bar of VS Code:

1. Click it â†’ choose **"Close Remote Connection"**
2. Or press `F1`, type `Remote-SSH: Close Remote Connection`, and hit Enter

---

### Option 2: **Disable Auto Remote Opening**

1. Go to `File â†’ Preferences â†’ Settings`
2. Search: `remote.SSH`
3. Find **"Remote.SSH: Explorer.enableHosts"** â€” disable it
   *(Or look for anything like "Automatically open remote on folder open" and turn it off)*

---

### Option 3: **Open Repository Locally Instead**

When cloning a repo in VS Code:

* Instead of pasting a URL like this:

  ```
  git@gitlab.com:chatbook/chatbook-backend.git
  ```
* Do the cloning **in the terminal manually**:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com-gitlab:chatbook/chatbook-backend.git
```

Then just open the local folder in VS Code:

```bash
cd chatbook-backend
code .
```

That keeps you in local mode and avoids VS Code trying to SSH into GitLab.

## âœ… Summary

| Symptom                                      | Fix                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| VS Code tries to "SSH" into `git@gitlab.com` | Donâ€™t use SSH URL in remote target          |
| Constant retries                             | Close remote window, disable auto-reconnect |
| You want to just clone                       | Use terminal to `git clone` â†’ then `code .` |

Let me know if you want help completely disabling VS Codeâ€™s SSH extension or configuring your `.vscode/settings.json` to avoid this.
